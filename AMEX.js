//Mutation testing and its use cases?
//Mutation testing is designed to ensure the quality of a software testing tool
//The goal is to ensure a software test can detect code that isn't properly tested or hidden defects that other testing methods don't catch
//Use cases
//Statement mutation. Statements are deleted or replaced with a different statement. For example, the statement "A=10 by B=5" is replaced with "A=5 by B=15."
//Value mutation. Values are changed to find errors. For example, "A= 15" is changed to "A= 10" or "A=25."
//Decision mutation. Arithmetic or logical operators are changed to detect errors. For example, "(A<B)" is changed to "(A>B)."
