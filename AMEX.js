//What is TDD and advantages of TDD?
//Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice where developers write tests before writing code
//It instructs developers to write new code only when an automated test has failed. As a result, this idea allows developers to take time to analyze the design or the main requirements for the final product before writing the main code
//Cons
//Improved code quality:
//Refactoring
//fater debugging
//Test coverage:

//Mutation testing and its use cases?
//Mutation testing is designed to ensure the quality of a software testing tool
//The goal is to ensure a software test can detect code that isn't properly tested or hidden defects that other testing methods don't catch
//Use cases
//Statement mutation. Statements are deleted or replaced with a different statement. For example, the statement "A=10 by B=5" is replaced with "A=5 by B=15."
//Value mutation. Values are changed to find errors. For example, "A= 15" is changed to "A= 10" or "A=25."
//Decision mutation. Arithmetic or logical operators are changed to detect errors. For example, "(A<B)" is changed to "(A>B)."

//Handling forms in React vs Angular
//React Forms require custom implementations for handling asynchronous validation. Form Initialization and Reset: Angular Reactive Forms simplify form initialization and resetting. You can easily set default values for form controls and reset the form to its initial state without manually managing each input field.
